# How to upload files to the Vobot Clock Tiny through the development kit

* The Vobot Clock Tiny has a built-in file system, which can be easily understood as a Python file that runs after power-on. This file can be read and written very conveniently by Thonny.

* Click on **View >>> Files**

* You will see a real-time file browsing window of the local and development boards on the left-hand side

* In the local file, **right-click >>> Upload to /** **plugins** to send the relevant files to the **plugins folder** of the development board, or send the files from the development board to the local device.

* Through the drop-down list, you can view the storage space of the MicroPython device and query all the Flash space and the remaining space of the development board.
