# Python Installtion

MicroPython is a concise and efficient implementation of Python 3, incorporating a small portion of the Python standard library while being optimized to run on microcontrollers and other limited environments. It includes many advanced features such as interactive prompts, closures, list comprehensions, generators, exception handling, and more, yet is still highly compact, requiring only 256k of code space and 16k of RAM. MicroPython is designed to be fully compatible with plain Python, making it easy to transfer code from your computer to a microcontroller or embedded system.

Therefore, it is necessary to install Python before we begin officially. In this chapter, we will introduce how to set up a local Python development environment.

Python is available on multiple platforms, including Linux and Mac OS X. 

You can check whether Python is installed locally and which version is installed by using the "python" command in the terminal window.

The official website of Python is [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/), and you can follow the instructions provided there to complete the installation.
