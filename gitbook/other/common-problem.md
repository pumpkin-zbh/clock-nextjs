# Common Problem

### How to reset the device to the factory default?

* Method 1: On any page, press and hold the button for 5 seconds, the device will be factory restored and the screen will go back to the setup phase.
* Method 2: When the device cannot connect to the current Wi-Fi, after about 1 minute, the device will go back to the setup phase. Thus taking the device to the place where the current Wi-Fi cannot cover will also have the device reset to the factory default.

### The device is showing the wrong time?

1. Please make sure the address information you filled in is correct.
2. Please check if your network is working well.
3. Please restore the device to factory default.
