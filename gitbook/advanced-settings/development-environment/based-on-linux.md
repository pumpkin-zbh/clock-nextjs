* If you're using a Raspberry Pi board, the Thonny IDE comes pre-installed, so no additional installation is required.

## Development kit usage

Since Thonny IDE can fully handle the programming and debugging functions of the development board, please refer to the Windows chapter [development Kit](based-on-windows.md) for usage.
